"# NLP_Project" 
Transformer-Based NLP Pipeline
This project demonstrates the use of Hugging Face's transformers library for various NLP tasks, including text generation, translation, sentiment analysis, and more. It uses pre-trained models and datasets to showcase encoding, tokenization, and evaluation processes.

Features
Translation: Translate English text to German and French using the T5 model.
Text Tokenization: Tokenize datasets using a BERT tokenizer and explore token IDs and attention masks.
Sentiment Analysis: Analyze sentiment using pre-labeled datasets from Hugging Face.
Conversational AI: Simulate multi-turn conversations using a text generation pipeline.
Dataset Loading: Load and process datasets like IMDB for real-world NLP applications.
Project Structure
Translation: Uses the T5 model for multilingual text translation.
Sentiment Analysis: Demonstrates the use of datasets like IMDB for classification tasks.
Text Encoding: Shows tokenization and exploration of input IDs and attention masks.
Conversational AI: Simulates conversations using text generation pipelines.
